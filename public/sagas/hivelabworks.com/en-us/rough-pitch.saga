The story so far...

The CEO of Hive Labworks is... @tarek, todo...

The CTO of Hive Labworks is an alumni of Netflix and the founder, owner, operator, and liason of Sillyz.Computer-- the original flying disk operating system-- a platform for kids (or anybody) to learn art, music, and coding, on and off the screen.

Hive Labworks is applied research and development institution, designed to decrease the time to market for new ideas by fostering collaboration at every step in the product development life cycle.

To demonstrate the cybersecurity of the Hive Labworks core engine, we're first targeting customers with strict privacy requirements, such as HIPAA and SOC2 compliance. In short, if your business is not in the business of selling personal information for any reason and you're not confident in your current techonology partners to deliver the privacy your customers have come to expect from you, we should talk.

Now, let's talk about all the other exciting use cases we're experimenting with in the hive. If you're disappointed we're not currently exploring your vertical, please reach out-- we're always cooking up new recipes, even if we're not serving them publicly yet.
